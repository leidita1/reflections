You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
 



 * What new skills have you learned?
 
As I had a little idea of what programing is, this first step was a little bit ease, but i lerned about other codes that i did not
use before, for example the styling for the letters or paragraphs.



 * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  
The basic concepts of programming have been ease, but for me was very difficult get to know the Udacity Platform.
I had many troubles with Udacity Feedback too, not getting the codes that are required for some quizes.
Also was challenging get to start programming with Sublime, because i did not know that you should make a little
programming inside Sublime in order to open your codes in Chrome and i have been having troubles too opening
some exercises without seeing results in Chrome.



* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Yes,i had to solve these problems with the recomended strategies, and also some other internal and external information
