<h3>How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?</h3>
<p>Because of that it would be a less time comsuption way of working. Everything would be always organized, it would be
enterely easy to manipulate any document we want</p>

<h3>What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having 
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?</h3>
<p>The pros are that you will always have the information of what bug or typo has been modified; when it has been
modified; information about the comparation between the new and old version of the document;this talking about Git. An 
automatically saved version would not give all this information and the programmador would not remember what changes that 
have been done.In my opinion, there are not cons comparing Git vs an automatically saving, but it has to be in mind
to keep commits always small and to do <i>one commit per logical change</1> so that, the information obteined will not
be long and hard to understand.</p>

<h3>Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?</h3>
<p>Because Git knows that multiple files might be correlated with each other, and that one single commit could affect these other files
that belog or are correlated to the file where the commit has been done.
Google docs propuse is only to save simple files or documents with not longer concern weather there are correlation in the changes
of documents or files or not.</p>



<h3>How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?</h3>
When you have download or cloned your repository, you can start making use of these commands. To start,  <b>git log</b> will show a list of
the recent commits with information about them, including commit ID.
Then we select two IDs -from git log info- to compare them with <b>git diff</b> to see the differences of those two commits; In other words, it shows when something 
has been added or delated in one of the files -"green" tells about the new inserctions, and "red" about the deletions-



<h3>How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?</h3>
<p>When I use a version control i can have the certainity that everytime i make a mistake while programming, i can just go to my version
control, look for the ID of the document or file where there is an error, and compare this file with another to see what has been changed,
so that, it is very easy to identify what has been added or delated and make the corrections. Version control also gives the possibility
of experimenting with your code with not fear of breaking the complete code.</p>


<h3>Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?</h3>
<p>At this time, I am not very sure</p>
